# SMPTE EB linear time cod generator.

ESP32 based SMPTE/EBU timecode generator, with NTP slaving, for Leitch and similar studio/broadcast clocks.

## Background

So we have a few  Leitch Illuminated 12 Inch SMPTE Timecode Analog Broadcast Studio Clocks and its more
modern digital, 19" rack sized variant. The each take a typical studio time signal; a SMPTE/EBU style
'audio' signal (4V p.p., baud, 80 bits, 2400Hz/4800hz FM modulated sequences of 80 bits).

These are then connected to some ESP32's that pick up the time from the office its NTP
serves; and provide these to the clocks.

It runs a small website to allow for a fiddle factor. E.g. to make sure people make their train.

## Timezone suport

Use is made of the Espressif build in time zone support. A more complete list of TZ specifiers
can be found at https://ftp.fau.de/aminet/util/time/tzinfo.txt and https://gist.github.com/alwynallan/24d96091655391107939

## Hardware

On the back of all clocks is a typical red/black two wire spring terminal. This is internally wired to
a 2x6 IDC connector; pin 1 and 2. It turns out that pin 3 and 4 contain a nice 5V voltage. All in all
these 4 wires are used to wire up the ESP32 (Wemos) boards.

The units seem to not always pick up a 3v3 Peak to Peak voltage generated by the GPIO. So we've added
a small BC546 transistor (base tied to the GPIO through a 2k2 registor, E to ground, C with a 1k pullup)
to raise the signal a bit.

Note that the polarity on the internal IDC connector seem to differ between revisions/versions of the clock (or we were a bit careless putting the wires in) -- hence the diode to protect and top it off a bit.

We've intentionally wired the transistors resistor to the original voltage - to get enough Vpp.

## RMT / pulse trains

Some of the clocks are very sensitive to timing that is lightly off; or when you skip a frame. The angry red error leds starts to flash accusingly for a few seconds then.

So we're using a careful double buffer approach with the hardwar based RTM pulse generator. As the latter will glitch when not fed multiples of 64 pulses we allow for 80 bit SMPTE/EBU frames to cross boundaries. This makes it a tad hard to figure out to 'set' the clock. 

## Caveats

The NTP is terribly primitive and lacks the usual long term phase locked loop that gives it nice, millisecond accuracy even when there are fluctuating network delays. Thus - we're not trying to aim for frame level accuracy. If that is of interest to you - the magic term is 'NTP clock discipline' and https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/discipline.html is a good primer.
